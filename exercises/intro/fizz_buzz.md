##Fizz Buzz

This is just one step above 'Hello World'.

Implement a program that counts to 100 following these rules:
 * If (n % 3 == 0) print 'fizz'.
 * If (n % 5 == 0) print 'buzz'.
 * When both of the above are true, both 'fizz' and 'buzz' are printed.
 * If neither of the previous were true, print the number.
