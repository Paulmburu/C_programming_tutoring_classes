##Tip Calculator

Using [command line options and arguments][command-line-opts-args-notes], write
a program to calculate a percent tip from a given total based on the arguments
provided on the command line.

This program should take one command line option, `-l`, which indicates the
total passed is an extra large number. The two command line arguments should be
the total cost (without tip), and the percent tip desired (as a whole integer).

Make sure to choose the right [data types][data-types-notes] depending on the
size and precision of your numbers!
