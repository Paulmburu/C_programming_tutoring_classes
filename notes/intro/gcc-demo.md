#Using GCC to Compile and Run C Programs

To see all `gcc` features:
```
gcc --help
```

To compile with gcc:
```
gcc file_name.c -o executable_name`
```

To run the program (in Mac):
```
./executable_name
```

To do both in the same step:
```
gcc file_name.c -o executable_name && ./executable_name
```
