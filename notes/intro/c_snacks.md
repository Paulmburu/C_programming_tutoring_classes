*tips and tricks*

 * Use `&&` and `||` as 'and' and 'or'.  They will lazy-evaluate left to right.
 * **Don't** use `&` and `|` as 'and' and 'or'.  They will always evaluate both
 sides and are used for bitwise operations.
 * If the body of an 'if' or 'while' block is one line, you may omit the `{}`.
 * 'do-while' will always run the block at least once.
