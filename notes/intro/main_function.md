#Main
```C
int main()
{
  /* your C code here */
  return 0;
}
```

The 'main' function is what gets run when you execute your program.
It counts as running without error if it returns 0, and if anything else is
returned then an error is raised.

This is how you, as the programmer, indicate whether the program is successful.
